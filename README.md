## Deliverables

- Demo Function Declaration:
  - Declare a function that takes a book as a parameter and return's the book's price formatted to look like currency. Given `inventory[0]` the return should be `"$10.00"`  
- Demo Function Expressions:
  - Create a function expression that takes a book as a parameter and returns a string consisting of the title and author of the book. Given `inventory[0]` the return should be `"Title: Eloquent JavaScript: A Modern Introduction to Programming by Marjin Haverbeke"`
- Demo Arrow Functions
- Demo Callbacks
  - Create a function that takes a callback function and an array
  - Inside the function, create a variable and set it to an empty array
  - Loop through the array property. Within the block, invoke the callback function and pass it the array element as an argument.
  - The return value of the callback should be pushed to the new array variable.
  - Return the new array variable
